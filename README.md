# Adoptsy

##### By Krystan Menne and Nathan Romike

Adoptsy is an Ember.js e-commerce app to manage dog adoptions. Admins can add dogs to a Firebase database; based on the dog's breed, the app categorizes the dog based on activity level, size potential, etc. Users can filter dogs by their preferences and add dogs to their "Doghouse" (a shopping cart type service) in order to schedule an appointment to meet the dogs.
